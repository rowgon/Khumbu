The pages are [fully translatable](https://complianz.io/translating-terms-conditions/), but come standard in many languages. The Terms & Conditions will default to your WordPress language. For multiple languages you can use WPML, Polylang and other translation plugins. To translate directly to your language, help us out as an editor or translate locally with Loco Translate for example.

You can always go back to the wizard to adjust your configuration. You can also edit the text by [unsynching with the wizard](https://complianz.io/editing-terms-conditions/) in the right colum of Gutenberg or Classic Editor.
= Can I style the Terms and Conditions? =
The Terms & Conditions have their own [CSS classes](https://complianz.io/styling-terms-conditions/), but by default will be styled by your theme's settings.
= What are Terms and Conditions =
Terms and Conditions, on the web, also known as Terms of Service or Terms of Use, is an agreement explaining the terms, rules, and guidelines to which a user must agree before entering a contractual relationship with the website owner.
